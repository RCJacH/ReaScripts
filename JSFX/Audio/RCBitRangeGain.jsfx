About:
  Suedo bit based gain adjustment for float point audio.
  1 bit ~= 6.0206 dB (doubling of distance).
  
  RCBitRangeGain solves two issues of the traditional dB-based gain plugin:
    1. When doing static gain alternation (meaning no automation) by twice/half of the sound pressure, 
       we often adjust the signal by 6dB. However 6dB is around 1.9952623149688795, rather than the 
       integer 2 which we desired, thus the signal will expand in number of digits, and truncate when
       it reaches the length of limit of the bit depth used for calculation, cause some sort of distortion,
       although likely inaudible. This is resolved by the AirWindows BitShiftGain algorithm, which adjusts
       volume by the exact number that represents bit shifting rather than dB.
    2. When doing dynamic gain alternation (with automation), there might occur a zipper noise, a sudden 
       high frequency distortion like aliasing (like that of the digital square wave), when moving the 
       volume slider too quickly. This is resolved by the AirWindows PurestGain algorithm, which does
       the volume change with smoothing effect. The result is no aliasing, but a bit slower reaction to
       changes. The original PurestGain fader has 4000 samples window of smooth effect, and I reduced it
       to 800, which in my opinion is a better balance between smoothness and reaction speed.

  By combining the two AirWindows algorithms, RCBitRangeGain can be used both statically and dynamically.
  Also I included other controls related to the basic concept so users can still break away from only
  doing 6dB gains, although when adjusting gains by anything other than bits will cause truncation.
  
  Instruction:
    * Use **Macro Shift** to increase or decrease audio input by 6.0206 dB per bit.
    * Use **Micro Shift** to fine adjust audio within 1 bit.
    * Use **Bit Ratio** to adjust the dB representation of one bit.
    * **Fader** is used as a controller of output volume in percentage after bit shifting.
    * Use **Fader Curve** to adjust the behavior of **Fader** slider.
    * Increase **Smooth Fader** if gain adjustment causes zipper noise.
    * **Pan** is used to balanced the volume of L-R channels.
    * Use **Pan Law (dB)** to determine whether the audio is attenuated or amplified when approaching center.
    * Increase **Smooth Pan** if pan adjustment causes zipper noise.
Changelog:
  * v1.3 (2018-09-27)
    + Using PurestGain Fader algorithm to change pan, so panning should be smoother now.
  * v1.2 (2018-04-12)
    + Added Pan controls
  * v1.1 (2018-02-13)
    + Implemented the actual algorithm of AirWindows OpenSourced PurestGain with variables.
    * Changed fader action, NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE if you used fader
    * Renamed to RCBitRangeGain
  * v1.0a (2017-01-31)
    + Renamed to BitRangeGain
  * v1.0 (2017-01-11)
    + Initial Release
